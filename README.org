#+title: Ray Grid Torch / C++

This holds a port of the Python/PyTorch version of ray grid in wire-cell-python,
itself a re-implementation of the original RayGrid/RayTiling in WCT.  This repo
holds the libtorch/C++ translation.  It's a temporary, stand-alone development
package prior to moving the code into WCT's "spng" package.
