     * @brief Returns a (5,2,2) pitch ray tensor suitable for giving to Coordinates().

     * Angle is from y-axis to wire direction.
     *
     * This function is equivalent to symmetric_raypairs() in WCT's
     * util/src/RayHelpers.cxx except it returns a pitch ray instead of a pair of
     * wire rays and it operates in 2D (x_rg, y_rg) instead of 3D (x_wc, y_wc,
     * z_wc). The coordinates correspondence is:
     *
     * y_rg == y_wc
     * x_rg == z_wc
     * z_rg == -x_wc

     * Note, z_rg is not used here but may be defined by right-hand-rule. Also by
     * RHR, "pitch cross wire = z_rg" (WCT it's opposite: "wire cross pitch = x_wc").
     *
     * Rays generally start on left hand side, pitch increasing toward right
     * (x_rg). This is equivalent to increasing with z_wc. Special case
     * horizontal rays start at bottom and go up.
     *
     * @param width The width of the detector area.
     * @param height The height of the detector area.
     * @param pitch_mag The magnitude of the pitch (e.g., wire pitch).
     * @param angle The angle in radians, from y-axis to wire direction.
     * @param options TensorOptions to control the dtype and device of the output tensor.
     * Defaults to double on CPU.
     * @return A torch::Tensor of shape (5, 2, 2) representing pitch rays.
